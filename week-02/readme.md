In week 2  I did  a full hands-on experience where I followed a structured team development workflow using Git and GitHub, applying each step practically rather than just learning theory. I began by preparing my environment, making sure Git was installed and configured correctly with my name and email so that my contributions would be properly tracked. After that, I either created or joined a repository set up for our team project, which was designed to simulate a real collaborative development environment where everyone contributes to the same codebase. 

Once the repository was ready, I cloned it to my local machine so I could work on the files directly. I verified that everything was working by checking the repository status, which confirmed that my working directory was clean and synchronized. Then I explored GitHub Projects, which functions as a task board, and learned how to view tasks in sections such as Backlog, In Progress, and Done so I could track development progress and understand how work is organized within a team workflow. 

After that, I followed the proper Git workflow cycle: I checked the project tasks, selected one assigned to me, and moved it to “In Progress” before starting. I pulled the latest changes from the main branch to make sure I was working with the newest version of the project, which is an important step to avoid conflicts. Then I created a new branch specifically for my task instead of working directly on the main branch, which is considered best practice because it keeps the main version stable and error-free. 

Next, I edited the project file by adding my contribution, which in this case was my recipe section inside the HTML file. After making changes, I checked what was modified using status and diff commands, staged my edits, and committed them with a clear message that referenced the issue number. Including the issue number links the work to the task and can automatically close it once merged, which helps maintain an organized workflow and history of changes. 

I then pushed my branch to GitHub and created a pull request, which is essentially a request asking the team to review my changes before merging them into the main branch. This step demonstrated how collaborative development works in real teams because it allows discussion, feedback, and quality checking before code becomes part of the final project. After review, the changes were merged and the branch was deleted as a cleanup step. 

Finally, I also practiced handling merge conflicts, which happen when two people edit the same part of a file. I learned how to read conflict markers, compare versions, choose or combine changes, and commit the resolved version so the project could continue smoothly. This showed how developers solve real-world collaboration problems and maintain consistency in shared codebases. 

Overall, I completed a full development cycle: setting up tools, collaborating in a shared repository, managing tasks, working with branches, committing and pushing changes, creating pull requests, reviewing code, merging updates, and resolving conflicts. Through this process, I practiced the exact workflow that real development teams use to build and manage projects efficiently and collaboratively.
