In addition to completing the technical workflow tasks, I also attended a meeting with the company where they introduced and explained their project concept, which is a mobile application focused on health tracking. During the session, they described that the app is intended to monitor key health metrics such as heart rate, step count, and other activity-related data, helping users stay aware of their physical condition and daily fitness levels. They discussed the purpose of the application, its practical use in everyday life, and how such tools are becoming increasingly relevant as people grow more interested in tracking and improving their health through technology.

During the discussion, I actively engaged by asking a question about whether the application was being designed for a specific target audience or age group. This was important to clarify because understanding the intended users can influence design choices, feature complexity, accessibility, and overall usability. The company responded that the app is mainly aimed at a mid-range audience, meaning typical adult users rather than very young users or elderly individuals. Their answer showed that the design and functionality would likely focus on general usability, balanced features, and straightforward health insights suitable for everyday users rather than specialized medical or highly technical audiences.

This interaction helped me better understand how real-world projects are planned, how companies define their user base before development, and how asking relevant questions can provide deeper insight into project goals and design direction. It also connected well with the practical Git and teamwork tasks I completed, since both experiences highlighted how planning, communication, and clarity are essential parts of professional development work.
