https://youtu.be/tiOCrXG3Fq4?si=O34M5Dtv2moRSkpQ
after watching this i went on flutter offical web,selected the option of downloading flutter for windows manually 
i downloaded a zip file from there 
After extracting the zip file ,i opened the flutter folder ,then i went in bin folder ,copied the path from there
searched envirnoment variable in my Pc ,then i went in system variable ,added a new path the one which i copied ,all set to Ok
After this ,i went on command prompt ,type the command flutter --version to cross verify that it's installed properly or not .
it showed that i got flutter 3.41.0 installed in pc
