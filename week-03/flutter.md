in week 3, we think about which framework we should  use for the mobile-app development ,we got options of .note,.React Native,.ionic .flutter
Among all of them we decided to choose flutter ,because it got  single code base for multiple platforms e.g Andriod,ios,web.
furthermore we can do fast development with hot reload and in addition to that it got the edge of customizable UI so we decided to use this framework.
